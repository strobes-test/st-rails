=== Storing Encrypted Files in Source Control

The Rails `encrypted` commands provide access to encrypted files or configurations.
See the `Rails.application.encrypted` documentation for using them in your app.

=== Encryption Keys

By default, Rails looks for the encryption key in `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` or
`config/master.key`, but that lookup can be overridden with `--key`:

   <%= executable(:edit) %> config/encrypted_file.yml.enc --key config/encrypted_file.key

Don't commit the key! Add it to your source control's ignore file. If you use
Git, Rails handles this for you.

=== Editing Files

To edit or create an encrypted file use:

   <%= executable(:edit) %> config/encrypted_file.yml.enc

This opens a temporary file in `$EDITOR` with the decrypted contents for editing.

=== Viewing Files

To print the decrypted contents of an encrypted file use:

   <%= executable(:show) %> config/encrypted_file.yml.enc
